* Clean Algorithms
Looking at psuedo code and dry, academic explanations of popular computer science data structures and algorithms can be one of the most excruciatngly boring and eye-bleeding things a student can do. Here, I want to present simple, clean, best practice driven implementations of these algorithms that can be easy to read,simple to follow, and good practice for me.
